Hi, my name is Robert Antenorcruz and you found my blog. I currently write about tech things (go figure) which is great, but my content is more anecdotal which I find better. I am a CompSci Major at CUNY Queens college with a focus on lower level programming, networking, and penetration testing.

<br/>
Some of my passionate projects have been a photography blog SNAPHD<br/>
