Hey! I'm Rob a mechanical keyboard lover <3 and programmer.
Most of my post are about pentesting and 1337 hax0r stuff, on which I am currently pursuing the OSCP cert.
Back in the day I worked on Super High Frequenecy satellite terminals, freelanced photography, and was co-owner to a Juice Bar.
Now in my free time you can find me pentesting VMs on HackTheBox, and conducting independent security research on HackerOne and BugCrowd.
