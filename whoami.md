IT by day.
Pentesting by night.

I am a **CompSci Major at CUNY Queens College** with an emphasis in Cyber-Security.
I also currently work in **IT at NYU Tandon School of Engineering** and am a former **Satellite Communications Operator in the United States Marine Corps Reserve**.

In my free time I am active on HackTheBox, Pentester Lab, Pentester Academy, OSCP, HackerOne, and Bugcrowd.
